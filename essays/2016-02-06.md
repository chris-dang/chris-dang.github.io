## I am an Artist?

Most people view coding from a scientific perspective, including me. However, there is a rising trend that tells users to view their code is art. In some ways, programming is like a work of art. *For artists, they start with a blank state and raw materials. For programmers, they begin with an empty page on a computer screen.* You can sketch out the overall shape then start to fill out the details. Now and then, you take a step back and throw the canvas away and start again. 

Growing up, I always had a creative background with me. Like art, I have this love-hate relationship with coding. I believe I speak for many of my peers when I say this. I am a total newbie when it comes to code and primarily JavaScript. I see JavaScript as a different type of regulation, and like art, there is always another style people prefer. As for me, I enjoy JavaScript as it is one of the kinds of creative coding. I believe that JavaScript is one of the brushes needed to create an art piece for software engineering.

## I am bad at anything Athletic.

Unfortunately, learning a new code does not pass through my mind quickly. When introduced to athletic software engineering, I was struck with great grief as I am not good at athleticism. I can not remember and put code together quickly. I can read the problem multiple times and know what to do, but I have trouble writing it. Every time I get put into groups, I always feel behind compared to my peers.

## WODs

Doing the WODs helps me. I enjoy the brain teasers as it forces me to think harder. Although I like the WODs, I am scared of doing it. I always end up confusing or making the problem harder than it already is. I know through more WODs and practice, Iâ€™ll get used to JavaScript. 

## Conclusion 

After all, to create the most beautiful masterpiece, it takes practice, time, and maybe a couple of coffee cups at midnight. I need to train my mindset to view software engineering as a different type of art and not just many words and numbers on a blank screen.
