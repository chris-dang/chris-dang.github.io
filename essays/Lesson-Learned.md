Figuring out how to turn into a computer programmer is tied in with learning and growing great techniques. A huge number of these techniques are effectively shown in the advancement of web applications, they are not restricted to simply software engineering. Throughout the span of these previous five months, I had the option to become familiar with a ton about programming as I picked up new aptitudes and enhanced old ones. While my insight just starts to expose what programming has to bring to the table, the things I've taken in this semester will be an incredible establishment in which I can additionally expand upon as I keep on getting familiar with the field. Although there were a few rocks thrown my way, the ideas and concepts I've gained from this will benefit me as I proceed on building my professional portfolio. 

## Coding Standards 

Coding principles are a bunch of complex standards and rules that a gathering of computer programmers follow to show up of their projects more uniformly.  Coding standards, when utilized for the correct reasons and in the correct way, offer numerous advantages. They make source code more intelligible and the product venture more viable. They likewise help get bugs and mix-ups that are veiled as apparently innocuous code. During this semester using ESLint on Intellij has been fairly intolerable, because in light of things. Using ESLint makes code aesthetically pleasing to look at. 

## Agile Project Management
*As cheesy as it sounds “ Teamwork makes the dream work*

Agile Project Management is an iterative way to deal with arranging and controlling undertakings progress. It separates the task into more modest pieces and makes it simpler to react to the issues on schedule. A type of Agile Project Management I want to talk about is called Issue Driven Project Management (IDPM). IDPM is an administration cycle intended to put together the task advancement of a little to medium estimated gathering of individuals. This takes into consideration ventures to be delivered in portions as they are finished. By utilizing this style of management, we partitioned the task into achievements, where every achievement had a set due date, we appointed issues for every achievement, at that point we made an undertaking board for every achievement, and afterward we allocated the issues in every achievement to our teammates. This really encouraged communication between our teammates and made it easier to manage our progress. 

## Coding Ethics

Ethics is significant in computer programming in light of the fact that crafted by the product engineer will in any case affect the general public. Morals are, in actuality, a necessity in each calling, from retail laborers to specialists. Prior to that class, I believed that morals was just about making the best choice, however I've come to comprehend that moral responsibility regularly depends on information – familiarity with your conduct and how it can impact others. From this I have focused on it to be more aware of the potential results of my expert practice.

## At the end...

Moving on, this semester has been a ride. This course has opened my eyes concerning what I really love about Computer Science and for that I am so appreciative. Toward the day's end, we do what we do in light of the fact that we love it, and in light of the fact that we need to help other people. With every calling, there is a moral code that we as a whole should notice, and when things enter an ill-defined situation, we should have the option to expertly deal with the circumstance.
