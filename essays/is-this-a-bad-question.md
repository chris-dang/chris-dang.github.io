## Yes, there are such things as dumb questions!

There are "no such things as dumb questions" we have heard this thousands of times before. This saying is regularly heard in classrooms when instructors are attempting to urge students to interact during exercises. They encourage students to questions and guarantee there is no such thing as a dumb question. As maybe Eric Steven Raymond, the creator of How to Ask Questions the Smart Way, would tend to disagree. His paper clarifies what brilliant inquiries are and how, when, and where to ask them.

Try to find an answer by:
1. searching the archives of the forum or mailing list that we plan to post to.
2. searching the web.
3. reading the manual.
4. reading a FAQ.
5. inspection or experimentation.
6. asking a skilled friend
7. reading the source code.

## Smart, very smart...

As we dissect [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11227809/why-is-processing-a-sorted-array-faster-than-processing-an-unsorted-array) question, we can see that the individual posing the inquiry has been taking a shot at this issue. This can be appeared by the broad measure of models and experimentation that has just been done and given. They have been contemplating this for some time and are eventually puzzled. Another thing is the question is straightforward and to the point as the user utilizes space and embeds code blocks between sentences.

## How to get Ignored 101 

[This](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56211119/can-help-me-about-execute-sql-in-java) is a case of how not to pose inquiries. Most importantly, the inquirer didn't endeavor to look for the arrangement himself/herself or provide further information. This title isn't just marginally ambiguous. However, it likewise utilizes the erroneous sentence structure. This can divert individuals off from tapping the inquiry and answering it. For those that aren't turned away by the dubiousness and inaccurate language, the extra data connected to the question is comparatively somewhat ambiguous, utilizes off base sentence structure, and doesn't give a great deal of detail their concern. 

## Conclusion

When we rely on others’ generosity and expertise to provide answers to our questions, it should hold that the question we ask should be one that leads to efficient and effective help that not only benefits us, but also the people we ask and others who might ask the same question in the future. Thus, if you have a question… make it a smart one! Asking questions may not always get you the best answer, but asking them in a way that will make others want to answer them will increase the success of finding a good solution and make it a positive experience on all sides.
